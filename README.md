This is a revised website for Russell's Transport. it is bootstapped with create-next-app using the Next 13 framework.

## Website Description
Russell's Transport is a dispatching trucking service. This website is their landing page to advertise the business, allow service requests and for truckers to submit applications to them.

## Updates
This site is an update from their previous site of the same name. As NextJS has updated the framework, I have taken the opportunity to rebuild the website with a different design language in mind. All components are colocated in a "Components" folder. API routes are rewritten, and the project takes full advantage of next 13's changes.

## Hosting
Vercel is the hosting platform of choice for the website.
